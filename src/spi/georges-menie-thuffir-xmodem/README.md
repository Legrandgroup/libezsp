This implementation of the XModem protocol has been copied over from https://github.com/Thuffir/xmodem
It is based on an initial implementation from Georges Menie, modified by [Thuffir](https://github.com/Thuffir) (github pseudo) to add support for XModem-1k (and YModem)

This source code is released by Geogres Menie as under the BSD license.

Specifications for XMODEM can be found [here](https://www.menie.org/georges/embedded/xmodem_specification.html)

Another implementation, released under MIT, has [been done by zonque (Daniel Mack)](https://gist.github.com/zonque/0ae2dc8cedbcdbd9b933)
